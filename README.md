# NYC Restaurant List

This is a small and somewhat useless app that loads NYC restaurants and their Department of Health scores, grades, and violation data. I put this together to test my React skills. Specifically:

- the dynamic loading and filtering of large data sets
- passing state and props between multiple child components
- build and deployment
